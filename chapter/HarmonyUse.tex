\chapter{Advanced use}

This chapter introduces the configuration of Harmony for advanced use : selection of sources and analyses, database configuration, parallelism.

	\section{Global configuration}
In this section we will look at the parameters of the JSON files used for the general configuration. By convention the name of these files end by `global-config.json'.
		\subsection{Database}
		By default Harmony uses the H2 database engine (\url{http://www.h2database.com/}) in its embedded form. Even though this configuration is sufficient for testing we recommend to use a database server for running large studies with Harmony.
		
		\subsection{Parallelism}
	
	\section{Source configuration}
In this section we will look at the parameters of the JSON files used for the sources configuration. By convention the name of these files end by `source-config.json'.
